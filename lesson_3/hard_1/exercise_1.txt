What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?

if false
  greeting = “hello world”
end

greeting

Answer: Output will be nil. Was expecting an unknown variable but as the variable was initialized in an if loop, even though the loop did not occur the variable was initialied to nil.

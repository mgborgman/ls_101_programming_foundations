What happens when we modify an array while we are iterating over it? What would be output by this code?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.shift(1)
end

Answer:
=> 1
=> 3
This occurs due to after each out put the array is changed. After the first iteration the array change to [2, 3, 4] but the loop thinks it has gone over the first item so it skips 2 and puts 3 to the screen. 

What would be output by this code?

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end

Answer:
=> 1
=> 2
Same as above except that with pop the numbers come off the end of the array not the beginning.

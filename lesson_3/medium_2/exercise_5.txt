What is the output of the following code?

answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8

Answer:
=> 34

This output is due to the fact that the code does not display the result of method mess_with_it() however it simply subtracts 8 from the answer variable during the p statement.

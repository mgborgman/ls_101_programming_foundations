Consider these two simple methods:

def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end
What would be the output of this code:

bar(foo)

=> 'no'

reason: you would have bar(foo(param = 'no'))
												output of foo => 'yes'
												bar('yes')
												output of bar('yes') => 'no'
